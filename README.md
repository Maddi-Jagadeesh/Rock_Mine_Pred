---Sonar Wave Signal Dataset---
---"Rock" vs "Mine" Prediction---

->This project applies Logistic Regression to classify sonar wave signals as either rocks or mines. 
->The dataset consists of sonar signals bounced off underwater objects, where the model predicts whether the detected object is a rock or a mine.

---Dataset---
->The dataset contains 60 numerical features representing sonar wave signal readings.
->The target variable is binary (Rock or Mine).


---Project Workflow---

---Data Preprocessing---

->Load the dataset
->Handle missing values (if any)
->Normalize/scale features for better model performance
->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---Visualize data distributions---

->Check class balance

---Model Training---

->Split data into training and testing sets
->Train a Logistic Regression model
->Model Evaluation using accuracy score


---Results---

->The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% .

---Future Improvements---
->Experiment with other classification models (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
->Perform feature selection to improve model efficiency.
->Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for a web-based interface.
